Alex, it's good to see that you've found a model that does what you are interested in. I would hope to see more detail in the description and derivation of the model in this figure. Not just what the different variables mean in the equation, but how the relate the refractive model. I also think I understand better what you intend to do with the computational model and I think outcome modeling is a great idea for what you want. There's a lot of parameter space to look into here (i.e., lots of things to vary), so you will need to think through what you intend to plot to demonstrate what your results will be. Great work so far.
