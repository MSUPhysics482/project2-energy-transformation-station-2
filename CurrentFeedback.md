Alex, I think that you have scoped a good project, but I'm wondering what models you are going to use for this proejct and specifcally how you plan to execute everything. That is, what is the timeline for you finishing the different parts of what you proposed to do. It will be important, especially, since you are working alone, to plan out your work, so that you don't get overwhelmed with it at the end. I'm hoping to see a really nice discussion of the different models that you might explore in the homework that you turn in on Monday. Good job!
