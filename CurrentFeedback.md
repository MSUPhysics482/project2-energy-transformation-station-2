## Feedback HW 11; Score: 16/20

Alex, this week I think I've gotten a much better sense of what you are trying to do, but please correct me if I am not right on this. It appears to me that you are modeling the transmission of energy through the different media as sunlight travels to a solar panel. Let me know if I have that right. The figure is helpful in understanding that and the code you have written seems to suggest that's what you are doing. It does appear that you are using "canned" formulae from a reference (ref. 1) to do this. I think that's fine, but I will expect that some variation in that formula is modeled and that you explain that. For example, you might assume perpendicular transmission until you get to the solar panel and then model different solar panel angles. You might model different atmospheric conditions. Any of those are fine, but think about how you might generate some variation among your model.
