Alex, thanks for the questions. I'll answer them as best I can.

How many variables would you like for me to change in the process? I had mentioned changing the outer atmosphere to include more ozone gases which would increase the index of refraction but what else would you like to see?
I think that depends on what you are trying to say about your work. You have a lot of different aspects you have in your Excel document, so I think you will need to string them together into a coherent research story here. You don't have to produce all the connections and variations between them, but something that tells a coherent and interesting (to you) story. Adding more ozone gases is a reasonable idea given the current state of EPA affairs, what is going to happen?!

The type of glass on the solar panels was something else I was planning on varying. Out of the figures created so far are there some that should be excluded or more that should be created?
Again, I think this connects to what story you want to tell. You choose the story line and use the analysis you need to tell that story.

Are sample calculations that you would like to see on the poster or only the results?
Great question. I think that some understanding of the models should be presented, but you don't need sample calculations. So you will need to demonstrate the models behind each of the important graphs with their explanantion and such, but no need to calculate on the poster.

Out of the listed figures what other figures might be helpful to include? All of these figures are found in the excel document partnerprojectfigures.xlsx
Same response as above - what's the cool story you want to tell?
