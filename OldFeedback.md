Alex, I think that you have scoped a good project, but I'm wondering what models you are going to use for this proejct and specifcally how you plan to execute everything. That is, what is the timeline for you finishing the different parts of what you proposed to do. It will be important, especially, since you are working alone, to plan out your work, so that you don't get overwhelmed with it at the end. I'm hoping to see a really nice discussion of the different models that you might explore in the homework that you turn in on Monday. Good job!

Alex, I think this could be a very neat project if you can gain access to the data, but it will need to explore how the underlying physics affects the real world measurements or the collected data that you have. If you perform some detailed analysis on the data you collect or obtain to compare it to real models using computation, then I think your project satisfies all the criteria. I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with regarding your plan.
