Alex, it's good to see that you've found a model that does what you are interested in. I would hope to see more detail in the description and derivation of the model in this figure. Not just what the different variables mean in the equation, but how the relate the refractive model. I also think I understand better what you intend to do with the computational model and I think outcome modeling is a great idea for what you want. There's a lot of parameter space to look into here (i.e., lots of things to vary), so you will need to think through what you intend to plot to demonstrate what your results will be. Great work so far.

Alex, I think that you have scoped a good project, but I'm wondering what models you are going to use for this proejct and specifcally how you plan to execute everything. That is, what is the timeline for you finishing the different parts of what you proposed to do. It will be important, especially, since you are working alone, to plan out your work, so that you don't get overwhelmed with it at the end. I'm hoping to see a really nice discussion of the different models that you might explore in the homework that you turn in on Monday. Good job!

Alex, I think this could be a very neat project if you can gain access to the data, but it will need to explore how the underlying physics affects the real world measurements or the collected data that you have. If you perform some detailed analysis on the data you collect or obtain to compare it to real models using computation, then I think your project satisfies all the criteria. I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with regarding your plan.
