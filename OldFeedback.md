Alex, I think this could be a very neat project if you can gain access to the data, but it will need to explore how the underlying physics affects the real world measurements or the collected data that you have. If you perform some detailed analysis on the data you collect or obtain to compare it to real models using computation, then I think your project satisfies all the criteria. I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with regarding your plan.
